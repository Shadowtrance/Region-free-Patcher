Region-free Patcher
==================================

This application for the 3DS patches the Home Menu and the NS service to allow region-free.
The screen will change colours for two seconds to indicate the result of the patching:
1. Green if it succeeded
2. Yellow if it failed

If it failed, you might need to reboot your 3DS before trying again, but the success rate should be quite high.
